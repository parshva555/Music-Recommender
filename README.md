Music Recommendation System
This repository contains a music recommendation system that uses clustering algorithms to recommend tracks based on user-selected songs. The system analyzes song features and provides personalized music recommendations.

Features
Music Recommendation System Development: Implemented a recommendation system using K-Means clustering and StandardScaler for personalized music suggestions.
Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: Used pandas for data cleaning, transformation, and feature extraction to prepare the Spotify dataset.
Cluster Analysis and Recommendation Strategy: Applied the elbow method and developed a frequency-based strategy for diverse song recommendations.
